SIR model Project Overview:

Parts 1 & 2 : Ian

Part 3: Isela Gonzales
This part involves using the least squares regression method in order to estimate the model parameter, k, as well as the initial condition, I0,
of the infected population. These estimates, with different data set sizes, were then compared to the true data from part 1 
Discussion:
Based on the results, the data from merely 10 days of running the model
deemed to be more accurate in comparison to 30 days of data. This could
be due to the values needed being at the beginning stages of the model
and the linearization of this model makes the more accurate numbers in
the beginning.

Part 4: Brendon
